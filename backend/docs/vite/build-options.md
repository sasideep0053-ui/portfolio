# Build Options ​

Unless noted, the options in this section are only applied to build.

## build.target ​

Type: string | string[]
Default: 'baseline-widely-available'
Related: Browser Compatibility
Browser compatibility target for the final bundle. The default value is a Vite special value, 'baseline-widely-available' , which targets browsers that are included in the Baseline Widely Available on 2026-01-01. Specifically, it is ['chrome111', 'edge111', 'firefox114', 'safari16.4'] .
Another special value is 'esnext' - which assumes native dynamic imports support and will only perform minimal transpiling.
The transform is performed with Oxc Transformer and the value should be a valid Oxc Transformer target option . Custom targets can either be an ES version (e.g. es2015 ), a browser with version (e.g. chrome58 ), or an array of multiple target strings.
Note the build will output a warning if the code contains features that cannot be safely transpiled by Oxc. See Oxc docs for more details.

## build.modulePreload ​

Type: boolean | { polyfill?: boolean, resolveDependencies?: ResolveModulePreloadDependenciesFn }
Default: { polyfill: true }
By default, a module preload polyfill is automatically injected. The polyfill is auto injected into the proxy module of each index.html entry. If the build is configured to use a non-HTML custom entry via build.rolldownOptions.input , then it is necessary to manually import the polyfill in your custom entry:

```
import 'vite/modulepreload-polyfill'
```

Note: the polyfill does not apply to Library Mode . If you need to support browsers without native dynamic import, you should probably avoid using it in your library.
The polyfill can be disabled using { polyfill: false } .
The list of chunks to preload for each dynamic import is computed by Vite. By default, an absolute path including the base will be used when loading these dependencies. If the base is relative ( '' or './' ), import.meta.url is used at runtime to avoid absolute paths that depend on the final deployed base.
There is experimental support for fine grained control over the dependencies list and their paths using the resolveDependencies function. Give Feedback . It expects a function of type ResolveModulePreloadDependenciesFn :

```
type ResolveModulePreloadDependenciesFn = ( url : string , deps : string [], context : { hostId : string hostType : 'html' | 'js' }, ) => string []
```

The resolveDependencies function will be called for each dynamic import with a list of the chunks it depends on, and it will also be called for each chunk imported in entry HTML files. A new dependencies array can be returned with these filtered or more dependencies injected, and their paths modified. The deps paths are relative to the build.outDir . The return value should be a relative path to the build.outDir .

```
modulePreload : { resolveDependencies : ( filename , deps , { hostId , hostType }) => { return deps . filter ( condition ) }, },
```

The resolved dependency paths can be further modified using experimental.renderBuiltUrl .

## build.polyfillModulePreload ​

Type: boolean
Default: true
Deprecated use build.modulePreload.polyfill instead
Whether to automatically inject a module preload polyfill .

## build.outDir ​

Type: string
Default: dist
Specify the output directory (relative to project root ).

## build.assetsDir ​

Default: assets
Specify the directory to nest generated assets under (relative to build.outDir . This is not used in Library Mode ).

## build.assetsInlineLimit ​

Type: number | ((filePath: string, content: Buffer) => boolean | undefined)
Default: 4096 (4 KiB)
Imported or referenced assets that are smaller than this threshold will be inlined as base64 URLs to avoid extra http requests. Set to 0 to disable inlining altogether.
If a callback is passed, a boolean can be returned to opt-in or opt-out. If nothing is returned the default logic applies.
Git LFS placeholders are automatically excluded from inlining because they do not contain the content of the file they represent.
Note
If you specify build.lib , build.assetsInlineLimit will be ignored and assets will always be inlined, regardless of file size or being a Git LFS placeholder.

## build.cssCodeSplit ​

Enable/disable CSS code splitting. When enabled, CSS imported in async JS chunks will be preserved as chunks and fetched together when the chunk is fetched.
If disabled, all CSS in the entire project will be extracted into a single CSS file.
If you specify build.lib , build.cssCodeSplit will be false as default.

## build.cssTarget ​

Default: the same as build.target
This option allows users to set a different browser target for CSS minification from the one used for JavaScript transpilation.
It should only be used when you are targeting a non-mainstream browser. One example is Android WeChat WebView, which supports most modern JavaScript features but not the #RGBA hexadecimal color notation in CSS . In this case, you need to set build.cssTarget to chrome61 to prevent vite from transforming rgba() colors into #RGBA hexadecimal notations.

## build.cssMinify ​

Type: boolean | 'lightningcss' | 'esbuild'
Default: 'lightningcss' , but false if build.minify is disabled for client build
This option allows users to override CSS minification specifically instead of defaulting to build.minify , so you can configure minification for JS and CSS separately. Vite uses Lightning CSS by default to minify CSS. It can be configured using css.lightningcss . Set the option to 'esbuild' to use esbuild instead.
esbuild must be installed when it is set to 'esbuild' .

```
npm add -D esbuild
```

## build.sourcemap ​

Type: boolean | 'inline' | 'hidden'
Default: false
Generate production source maps. If true , a separate sourcemap file will be created. If 'inline' , the sourcemap will be appended to the resulting output file as a data URI. 'hidden' works like true except that the corresponding sourcemap comments in the bundled files are suppressed.

## build.rolldownOptions ​

Type: RolldownOptions
Directly customize the underlying Rolldown bundle. This is the same as options that can be exported from a Rolldown config file and will be merged with Vite's internal Rolldown options. See Rolldown options docs for more details.

## build.rollupOptions ​

Deprecated
This option is an alias of build.rolldownOptions option. Use build.rolldownOptions option instead.

## build.dynamicImportVarsOptions ​

Type: { include?: string | RegExp | (string | RegExp)[], exclude?: string | RegExp | (string | RegExp)[] }
Related: Dynamic Import
Whether to transform dynamic imports with variables.

## build.lib ​

Type: { entry: string | string[] | { [entryAlias: string]: string }, name?: string, formats?: ('es' | 'cjs' | 'umd' | 'iife')[], fileName?: string | ((format: ModuleFormat, entryName: string) => string), cssFileName?: string }
Related: Library Mode
Build as a library. entry is required since the library cannot use HTML as entry. name is the exposed global variable and is required when formats includes 'umd' or 'iife' . Default formats are ['es', 'umd'] , or ['es', 'cjs'] , if multiple entries are used.
fileName is the name of the package file output, which defaults to the "name" in package.json . It can also be defined as a function taking the format and entryName as arguments, and returning the file name.
If your package imports CSS, cssFileName can be used to specify the name of the CSS file output. It defaults to the same value as fileName if it's set a string, otherwise it also falls back to the "name" in package.json .

```
import { defineConfig } from 'vite' export default defineConfig ({ build : { lib : { entry : [ 'src/main.js' ], fileName : ( format , entryName ) => `my-lib-${ entryName }.${ format }.js` , cssFileName : 'my-lib-style' , }, }, })
```

## build.license ​

Type: boolean | { fileName?: string }
Related: License
When set to true , the build will generate a .vite/license.md file that includes all bundled dependencies' licenses.
If fileName is passed, it will be used as the license file name relative to the outDir . If it ends with .json , the raw JSON metadata will be generated instead and can be used for further processing. For example:

```
[ { "name" : "dep-1" , "version" : "1.2.3" , "identifier" : "CC0-1.0" , "text" : "CC0 1.0 Universal \n\n ..." }, { "name" : "dep-2" , "version" : "4.5.6" , "identifier" : "MIT" , "text" : "MIT License \n\n ..." } ]
```

TIP
If you'd like to reference the license file in the built code, you can use build.rolldownOptions.output.postBanner to inject a comment at the top of the files. For example:

```
import { defineConfig } from 'vite' export default defineConfig ({ build : { license : true , rolldownOptions : { output : { postBanner : '/* See licenses of bundled dependencies at https://example.com/license.md */' , }, }, }, })
```

## build.manifest ​

Type: boolean | string
Related: Backend Integration
Whether to generate a manifest file that contains a mapping of non-hashed asset filenames to their hashed versions, which can then be used by a server framework to render the correct asset links.
When the value is a string, it will be used as the manifest file path relative to build.outDir . When set to true , the path would be .vite/manifest.json .
If you are writing a plugin and need to inspect each output chunk or asset's related CSS and static assets during the build, you can also use viteMetadata output bundle metadata API .

## build.ssrManifest ​

Related: Server-Side Rendering
Whether to generate a SSR manifest file for determining style links and asset preload directives in production.
When the value is a string, it will be used as the manifest file path relative to build.outDir . When set to true , the path would be .vite/ssr-manifest.json .

## build.ssr ​

Produce SSR-oriented build. The value can be a string to directly specify the SSR entry, or true , which requires specifying the SSR entry via rolldownOptions.input .

## build.emitAssets ​

During non-client builds, static assets aren't emitted as it is assumed they would be emitted as part of the client build. This option allows frameworks to force emitting them in other environments build. It is responsibility of the framework to merge the assets with a post build step.

## build.ssrEmitAssets ​

During the SSR build, static assets aren't emitted as it is assumed they would be emitted as part of the client build. This option allows frameworks to force emitting them in both the client and SSR build. It is responsibility of the framework to merge the assets with a post build step. This option will be replaced by build.emitAssets once Environment API is stable.

## build.minify ​

Type: boolean | 'oxc' | 'terser' | 'esbuild'
Default: 'oxc' for client build, false for SSR build
Set to false to disable minification, or specify the minifier to use. The default is Oxc Minifier which is 30 ~ 90x faster than terser and only 0.5 ~ 2% worse compression. Benchmarks
build.minify: 'esbuild' is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
Note the build.minify option does not minify whitespaces when using the 'es' format in lib mode, as it removes pure annotations and breaks tree-shaking.
esbuild or Terser must be installed when it is set to 'esbuild' or 'terser' respectively.

```
npm add -D esbuild npm add -D terser
```

## build.terserOptions ​

Type: TerserOptions
Additional minify options to pass on to Terser.
In addition, you can also pass a maxWorkers: number option to specify the max number of workers to spawn. Defaults to the number of CPUs minus 1.

## build.write ​

Set to false to disable writing the bundle to disk. This is mostly used in programmatic build() calls where further post processing of the bundle is needed before writing to disk.

## build.emptyOutDir ​

Default: true if outDir is inside root
By default, Vite will empty the outDir on build if it is inside project root. It will emit a warning if outDir is outside of root to avoid accidentally removing important files. You can explicitly set this option to suppress the warning. This is also available via command line as --emptyOutDir .

## build.copyPublicDir ​

By default, Vite will copy files from the publicDir into the outDir on build. Set to false to disable this.

## build.reportCompressedSize ​

Enable/disable gzip-compressed size reporting. Compressing large output files can be slow, so disabling this may increase build performance for large projects.

## build.chunkSizeWarningLimit ​

Type: number
Default: 500
Limit for chunk size warnings (in kB). It is compared against the uncompressed chunk size as the JavaScript size itself is related to the execution time .

## build.watch ​

Type: WatcherOptions | null
Default: null
Set to {} to enable rollup watcher. This is mostly used in cases that involve build-only plugins or integrations processes.
Using Vite on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 2
There are cases that file system watching does not work with WSL2. See server.watch for more details.
